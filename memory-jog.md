Finished!

22. Congratulations! We finished with our project and have a fully functional game that uses scene transitions, animations, and tweens!

If you want to challenge yourself:

- Add a tween that plays when the correct circle is clicked.
- Change the “wrong” tween to temporarily show the number of the circle.
- Create an options screen for players:
  - How long to display the numbers (without being blocked).
  - How many circles/numbers to display.
