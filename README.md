#### LEARN GAME DEVELOPMENT WITH PHASER.JS

## Codey's Counting Conundrum

Let’s combine our knowledge of scene transitions, animations, and tweens into a single game.

The game that we’re going to build out draws inspiration from a game used to study chimpanzee memory. The premise of the game is that numbers flash on the screen for a brief period of time before being covered by circles. The goal is to then click on the circles in the correct order from smallest to largest.
